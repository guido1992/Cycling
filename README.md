This repo shows code which cleans and manipulates files from Strava to produce a clean file which I have used to previously visualise data in Tableau. Next step, may be to build a Streamlit application using python libraries and hosting this on the web.

For now, you can view the python scripts that clean the file extracts from Strava.
